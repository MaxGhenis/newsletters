Here's our analysis of 4 policies the government may announce:

🧵👇

## 1. Two-Child Limit

The two-child benefit limit restricts Universal Credit to the first two children.

Our analysis of abolishing it:
• Cost: £2.5bn/year
• 300,000 children lifted out of poverty
• Child poverty rate falls 1.2pp

## 2. Income Tax & NI Reforms

Reported: +2pp income tax, -2pp NI, extended freezes

Our findings:
• +£6.9bn revenue
• Under £58k: gain
• Over £58k: lose up to £1,748/year
• Pensioners pay only the IT hike

## 3. VAT Thresholds

The Telegraph reported a potential VAT threshold increase.

Our analysis:
• £100k threshold: -£371m, exempts ~48,000 firms
• £70k threshold: +£642m, adds 109,000 firms

## 4. Mansion Tax

Reported: levy on homes over £2m.

We mapped 2024 property sales:
• 3 central London seats: 21% of high-value sales
• London overall: 45-46%
• Top 10 seats (all London/commuter belt): 36%

🇬🇧 Chancellor Reeves delivers the Autumn Budget at 12:30 PM today.

PolicyEngine has analysed four policies the government may announce:

**1. Two-Child Benefit Limit**
Abolishing would cost £2.5bn/year but lift 300,000 children out of poverty.

**2. Income Tax & NI Reforms**
A combined +2pp IT / -2pp NI package would raise £6.9bn. Households under ~£58k gain; higher earners lose up to £1,748.

**3. VAT Thresholds**
Raising to £100k would cost £371m and exempt ~48,000 firms from registration.

**4. Mansion Tax**
A levy on homes over £2m would concentrate in London—three constituencies account for 21% of affected properties.

Our Autumn Budget Dashboard with real-time analysis launches this afternoon.
