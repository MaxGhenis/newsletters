Upload a newsletter HTML file to Mailchimp as a draft campaign with audience targeting.

## Usage

```bash
/upload-draft editions/2025-10-02-uk.html --audience uk --subject "Subject line" --preview "Preview text"
```

## Process

This is a wrapper around the `upload-newsletter` command that:

1. Validates the HTML file exists
2. Prompts for required fields if missing
3. Runs the upload command
4. Shows the Mailchimp edit URL

## Arguments

- `html-file`: Path to newsletter HTML file (required)
- `--audience`: Target audience - `uk`, `us`, or `all` (required)
  - `uk`: Only UK subscribers (COUNTRY = "United Kingdom")
  - `us`: All non-UK subscribers (COUNTRY ≠ "United Kingdom")
  - `all`: All subscribers
- `--subject`: Email subject line (required)
- `--preview`: Preview text shown in inbox (required)
- `--title`: Optional internal campaign title (defaults to filename)

## Implementation

```bash
upload-newsletter $ARGUMENTS
```

## Example

```bash
/upload-draft editions/2025-10-02-uk.html \
  --audience uk \
  --subject "Join us for PolicyEngine 2.0 launch • 3 November in London" \
  --preview "Register for our flagship event at Central Hall Westminster. Plus: happy hour tonight, and new research on carbon taxes and VAT."
```
